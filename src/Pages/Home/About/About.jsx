      I started my journey in programming after completing my graduation in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. While EEE gave me a strong foundation, I discovered my true passion in web development, where I can blend creativity with problem-solving.  

      The journey wasn’t easy, but learning technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js has been both challenging and rewarding. Each project I’ve worked on has taught me something new and inspired me to grow as a developer.  

      Besides programming, I love reading books, crafting, and wall painting. These creative activities keep me motivated and bring balance to my life. My goal is to keep learning, building meaningful projects, and growing as a developer.
